# DML
An Object Oriented Web Programming Framework

DML is a Javascript framework for object oriented web programming. Unlike other frameworks it does not implement a new syntax or itÂ´s own unique logic. Alle you need is already implemented in modern browsers. DML just adds a new and radical approach to use object oriented technics (OO) to create stunning web pages and powerful web applications using Javascript only. 

Don't be fooled by the apparent simplicity: DML provides a complete design platform with web components and templates - just in a very different way you may be used to. Just add the DML-Library to your website and start HTML-Programming... And let the power of OO be with you!

A minimal DML page will look like this:

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="de">

<head>
  <meta charset="utf-8">
  <title>title</title>
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <script src="..\lib\DML.js"></script>
</head>

<body>
  <script>  "use strict";
    h1("test")
    p("test")
  </script>
</body>

</html>
```
